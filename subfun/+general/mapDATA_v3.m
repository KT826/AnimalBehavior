function [mapout,mapset] = mapDATA_v3(x,y,ls,p,bs)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%   This function bins any type of x,y data into a 3D (x,y,count) map or histogram
%   This version has been reworked so that x,y data can be easily corrected to match
%   bins in the map. It has also been changed to accept only data in cm, not pixels
%   [mapout,mapset] = mapDATA_v2(x,y,ls,p,bs)
%
%%%%%%%% Inputs
%   x = x coordinates of data
%   y = y coordinates of data
%   ls = map limits (if required) in the format [xmin xmax ymin ymax]
%   p = (default = 2) padding for data in bins
%   bs = (default = 2) the binsize in cm 
%
%%%%%%%% Outputs
%   mapout = the 2d map of the data, unsmoothed. This is created so that the centre of the x,y data falls on in the centre point of the map
%   mapset = a structure containing the bin edges of the map and corrected position data:
%         mapset.bin_pix = the binsize in pixels
%         mapset.xloc = x bin edges
%         mapset.yloc = y bin edges
%         mapset.xnew = x data corrected to match map
%         mapset.ynew = y data corrected to match map
%
%   to convert other position or spike data to match the map do this:
%         newx = (oldx /(bs / 100 * pr)) + (size(mapout,2) / 2)
%         newy = (oldy /(bs / 100 * pr)) + (size(mapout,1) / 2)
%
%%%%%%%% Comments
%   08/08/16 created as a simple mapping function
%   20/04/17 created from mapDATA because I want a function I can use with overdispersion
%   20/04/17 function now outputs converted position data (to match map)
%   20/04/17 added limit capability so spike and time maps can be made with same limits
%   27/07/17 changed to v3, this version expects data to be in cm, not pixels (meant to work with variable pixel ratio klustest)
